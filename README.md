# Travel agency case study
A business analytics case study using customer data from a travel agency. 

A travel agency has been collecting information on the individuals or families that have booked holidays with the firm over the past few years.  The company has recently installed SASÂ® Software which enables their analysts to explore the data and gain valuable insight into their customer base.  The data is stored in text files.  The analytics manager intends to import this data into SAS, combine the data sources and produce various reports and analyses.

### To run:

1. Open autoexec.sas in a new SAS session and enter the path to the current directory, then run the autoexec.sas program.

2. Either run the entire control.sas program, or open the file and run each section separately. Note: Sections A, B and C must be run in order.
